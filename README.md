Tools for Matrix Algebra, Optimization and Inference Problems
=============================================================

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/kisungyou/maotai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kisungyou/maotai)

`maotai` is an acronym for Matrix Algebra, OpTimization, and Inference problems - though I can't deny motivation from one of [my father's favorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maotai) for the namesake. More detailed introduction will be added later.
