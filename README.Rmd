# Tools for Matrix Algebra, Optimization and Inference Problems

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/kyoustat/maotai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kyoustat/maotai)

`maotai` is an acronym for Matrix Algebra, OpTimization, and Inference problems - though I can't deny motivation from one of [my father's favorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maotai) for the namesake. More detailed introduction will be added later.

## Installation

`maotai` released version can be obtained from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maotai) with:
